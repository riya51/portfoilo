<h2><U>Git and Git hub</U></h2>
<P>It was a wonderfull experiencein git and git hub. Initially I had no idea about
     the tasks that was given on github. I was so curious and interested to learn about it.
      I was in the second batch in this series. I watched the videos sent by the mentors and
 followed their suggestions. In this way I was able to complete my series of tasks.
  With the help of git and github I learned programming such as adding ,commiting,
   merging,pushing and pulling to git merging and forking. I also got the basic features
    of git workflow.I found it very helpful.<br>It was very amazing and enlightening to learn about programming at a very early age. I would like to use it when I would go in this field.<br><H3>You can visit to my <a href="https://github.com/riya51/github_series">git repo.</a></P></h3>
